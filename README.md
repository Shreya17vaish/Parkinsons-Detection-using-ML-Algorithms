# Parkinsons-Detection-using-ML-Algorithms

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT

OBJECTIVE : To compare the accuracy of different 
machine learning algorithm and secure the approx value of 
training and testing model accuracy.

SCOPE : ML algo trained on huge datasets of patient 
information to learn patterns and characteristics that are 
associated with PD. This can help in the development of 
predictive models that can accurately detect the disease in 
its early stages, even before symptoms become apparent.

RESULT : Compare the accuracy of training and testing 
dataset of model whether it is overfitting and underfitting 
if it is neither from these two then it means algorithm is 
performing well on the dataset. SVM is performing better 
in training as well as testing than the KNN and RF.
